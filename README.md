# Iris-Species-Predictor-ML-Flask-App-With-logit_model-knn_model-svm_model
in this project we first it did exploratory data analysis to Understand each attribute and Understand relationship between attributes then we used ML models like KNeighborsClassifier,SVC and
LogisticRegression to make predictions on them. then we put the three models int flask app to make prediction on Iris Species
